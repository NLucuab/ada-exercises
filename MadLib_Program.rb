# Wrtie a MadLib program 
# First play a few on eduplace to become familiar with the game
# Create a MadLib program that accepts input from the user and outputs a completed MadLib
# Use up to ten different parts of speech in order to fill in your MadLib
# Output should consist of a paragraph of output that has the user's input substituted into the MadLib
# we have provided an example run, but your MadLib program should be unique to you.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not to worry! These moonpies will be the most #{adjective2} moonpies you have ever had!
Hmmm...maybe we could make them taste like #{food1}? Anywho, let's try not to think too much about #{noun2} while we do this!
What's the secret to these utterly delicious moonpies? Simple: Do not be #{verb1} by the #{noun3}. Happy cooking!"
